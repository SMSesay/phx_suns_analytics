# Analytics Engineering Project


## Problem Statement
The Phoenix Suns is a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise. The Regular Season in Basketball is done and the Phoenix Suns want to assess the shooting performance of some of their key players accross the season. They currently have been delivered unstructured data in the form of .csv files however the Analytics team would like to access the data in a much better format and be able to report on the data that can be translated to key stakeholders such as the General Manager and Head Coach.

## Project Overview
This Project aims to store unstructured data in a Warehouse/Database for Analytics teams to access the data in a more structured format. Once the data is stored in its desired location the data will then be transformed so that it can inform the Phoenix Suns organisation on the performance of their players. Additionally the Project will like to report on this data using a compatible Visualization tool.
